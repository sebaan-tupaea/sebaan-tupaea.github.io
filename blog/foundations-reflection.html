            <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>The Influence of Self-Perception:</strong> I have realised that my self-perception deeply influences how I act and interact with others. I often let my ego inflate my confidence, which sometimes led me to overlook the help I needed. Now, I see that acknowledging my limitations and asking for feedback is not a sign of weakness but a step towards genuine growth. I would rather aim for perfection and embrace the process of seeking help than pretend I have everything figured out.</li>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Prioritising My Current Work Over Teamwork:</strong> My current professional responsibilities have often taken precedence over opportunities for group work. This focus has limited my experience with teamwork so far. Human Skills learning has underscored the value of collaboration and how it contributes to overall success. I would rather work on enhancing my ability to collaborate effectively and strive for excellence in both individual and team settings.</li>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Learning to Embrace Feedback:</strong> I have come to realise that I used to react to feedback defensively, viewing it as a personal judgement instead of a tool for growth. Human Skills learning has shifted my perspective, helping me understand that feedback is a valuable resource for enhancing my skills. I now aim to embrace feedback as an opportunity to refine my abilities and achieve my best, rather than seeing it as a setback.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="color: #608062;">For me, <strong>values</strong> act as a compass in my studies and coding projects. By embracing values like integrity and dedication, I aim for excellence and always give my best effort. I understand that staying true to these values also means admitting when I need help, even if it feels uncomfortable.</li>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Empathy</strong> is very important for understanding different perspectives, whether I am learning something new or working on a coding project. Even though I have not done much teamwork yet, being empathetic helps me appreciate other people’s ideas and get along better when I do work with others. In programming, it is all about thinking about the user’s experience to ensure my solutions are practical and easy to use. Self-empathy is equally important because it helps me be kind to myself when I am struggling. By being empathetic towards both others and myself, I can improve my projects and grow personally.</li>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Self-awareness</strong> helps me understand my own strengths and limitations. I have learned that recognising when I need help and handling feedback constructively is crucial for my development. For example, my tendency to aim for perfection sometimes leads me to focus too much on details, which can slow me down. Being self-aware allows me to adjust my approach and manage my time more effectively.</li>

            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Dance Classes:</strong></li>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Dance Classes:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Dance Classes:</strong></li>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Dance Classes:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Dance Classes:</strong></li>
              <li style="color: #608062;"><strong>Dance Classes:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
