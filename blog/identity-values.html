          <p><em>"Who you are and what you bring shapes your learning journey."</em></p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
              Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
              the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
            </li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">Last summer, while working at a public pool, I noticed a mother taking food from the snack bar without paying. Earlier, she had paid with a bunch of small coins, and it seemed like she and her family might have been living in their car. She only took enough food for her children, so I decided to let it slide and covered the cost by using our tips to balance the books. I made sure not to draw attention to her but started a policy of putting the snacks away before cleaning to avoid similar situations. Looking back, I would do the same if not more, as it felt like the right balance of empathy and responsibility.</p>

            <li>
              Describe how your culture and the people around you have
              influenced your values and identity.
            </li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">My MƒÅori and Samoan upbringing has given me a solid foundation in community and respect. On top of that, my female friendships have been incredibly important in shaping who I am today. These friendships provide me with support and understanding, boosting my confidence and helping me grow. Combining these cultural values with the encouragement of my friends has created a life focused on empathy, mutual support, and meaningful relationships.</p>

            <li>
              Identify your strengths and how they will support you during
              your learning journey.
            </li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">My curiosity will keep me engaged and excited about diving into new topics and concepts, making sure I stay motivated throughout my learning journey. My persistence means I won't back down from challenges and will keep pushing through until I figure things out, even when it gets tough.</p>

            <li>
              Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
              development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">I sometimes feel overwhelmed when I am hit with too much information all at once, and my tendency to aim for perfection can slow me down by making me fixate on details. Balancing learning with other responsibilities, especially since I work during the week, can be challenging. If I do not manage my time effectively, I might end up procrastinating or rushing through tasks. These limitations can disrupt my learning process and make it harder to stay on track. However, improving my stress management and time organisation can help me overcome these hurdles.</p>

            <li>
              Share an example of when you were trying to work productively
              with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
              strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
              your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and
              why.
            </li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">When I was working at the pool with my friends and was in a managerial role, I encountered some resistance and tension. To address this, I set clearer boundaries and communicated expectations more explicitly. Despite these efforts, it was still challenging to manage both my authority and our friendships effectively.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;">Looking back, I realise that while setting boundaries was a good start, I could have done better by adding more structure and having regular catch-ups to keep everyone on the same page. Now, I would try to involve everyone in decisions and really listen to their feedback, to make things run smoother and keep the team vibe positive. </p>
