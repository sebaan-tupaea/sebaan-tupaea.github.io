          <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Were blocked on a simple problem:</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Problem:</strong> I encountered a simple issue with spelling errors in my code. It was frustrating because it seemed so minor, yet it caused the code not to function correctly.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Problem-Solving Techniques:</strong> I pasted my code and the question into Google, and after browsing through some forums and ChatGPT advice, I realised that typos, particularly in variable or function names, are often the issue. That led me to quickly spot and fix the spelling mistake.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Feelings Throughout the Process:</strong> At first, I was really frustrated and kind of annoyed that something so small was causing such a big issue. However, as I worked through the problem, I began to feel more determined to fix it.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned the importance of attention to detail and how even minor errors like misspellings can have significant impacts. It was a reminder to stay patient and thorough when debugging.</p>
         

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Elegantly solved a problem:</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Problem:</strong> The links on my blog were not working online, making it impossible to navigate between different sections of the site. </p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Problem-Solving Techniques:</strong>   used pseudocode to map out the logic for the navigation links. This helped me visualise the structure and identify where the issues were. I discovered that the problem was using absolute paths instead of relative paths for different directories. After correcting the paths to relative ones, the links started working properly.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Feelings Throughout the Process:</strong>   I felt overwhelmed due to the lack of results for my efforts. However, once I applied the pseudocode and fixed the paths, I felt a sense of relief and satisfaction.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>What I Learned:</strong>  I learned that pseudocode can be a great way to organise and clarify problems, especially when dealing with complex issues like path management. It’s crucial to use relative paths in navigation to ensure links work correctly across different directories.</p>
             <li style="font-weight: bold;">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these:</li>
            <p>  </p>
            <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
              <tr>
                <th style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px; background-color: #D9596C; color: #fff;">Problem-solving techniques/processes</th>
                <th style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px; background-color: #D9596C; color: #fff;">Reflection</th>

              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Pseudocode</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">I am moderately confident using pseudocode. It helps to plan and organise my thoughts, but I still find it challenging to translate it into code sometimes.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Trying something</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Fairly confident in trying out different approaches when I am stuck. It often helps me find solutions or new methods, though it does not always work out perfectly.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Rubber ducky method</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">This technique is quite useful for me. Talking through my problem helps clarify my thoughts and often leads to breakthroughs.</td>

              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Reading error messages</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Error messages are usually clear indicators of what went wrong, and I rely on them heavily to guide my debugging process.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Console.logging</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">I have some confidence using console.log for debugging, but it's usually an afterthought and the last technique I consider.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Googling</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Very confident in my ability to Google effectively. It is an invaluable tool for finding solutions, understanding concepts, and learning from others’ experiences.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Asking your peers for help</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">I am not very confident asking peers for help. I sometimes hesitate if I think the problem is too simple or if I feel it might be seen as a nuisance.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Asking coaches for help</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Also not very confident asking coaches for help. I tend to feel reluctant to bother them with what might seem like minor issues.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">Improving your process with reflection</td>
                <td style="width:50%; border: 1px solid #608062; padding: 8px;">I feel confident reflecting on my process. It helps me identify areas for improvement and reinforce what worked well.</td>

                        <p>  </p>
  
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Situation:</strong> I spent the weekend working on the Super Flip Flop question in the JavaScript kata. It was a tough problem, and I stayed up late trying to solve it. Since the facilitators were finished for the week, I could not get their help during this time.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>What Made Me Reluctant:</strong> The main factor was a fear of being judged for not knowing the answer. I also felt a sense of pride in wanting to solve the problem independently.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>What I Might Try Differently Next Time:</strong> Next time, I would remind myself that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. Everyone needs help at some point, and seeking advice can lead to quicker, more effective solutions. I would also consider that collaborating with others can provide new insights that I might not have considered on my own.</p>
