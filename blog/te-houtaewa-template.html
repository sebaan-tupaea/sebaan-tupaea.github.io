          <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
          <p>
            Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many
            pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted
            kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to
            the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch
            the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for
            Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived
            there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the
            wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a
            Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to
            heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the
            people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes)
            situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was
            spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
