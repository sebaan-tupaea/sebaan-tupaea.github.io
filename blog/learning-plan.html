        <div class="blog-posts">
            <ol>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
             <p style="color: #608062;">My long-term goal is to be the ‘guy in the chair’ xx</p>
             <p style="color: #608062;">Long term, I want to be a DevOps engineer—getting into automating workflows, solving problems, and keeping the IT scene on flawless. As a student, I am hungry to learn, level up, and bring some real drive to the tech game, making sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">I have a passion for learning and exploring new ideas, which keeps me curious and motivated to dive deeper. I am pretty persistent, tackling tough problems until I solve them, and I am adaptable, able to switch up my learning approach to fit different materials and teaching styles. These strengths help me grow and stay engaged with challenging topics.</p>
              <p style="color: #608062;">However, time management is where I struggle the most. Juggling multiple complex subjects and other responsibilities can be overwhelming, and I sometimes fall into procrastination or end up rushing my work at the last minute. My perfectionism does not help either, as it slows me down, making it hard to move on until everything feels just right. Improving how I balance these elements is something I really need to work on.</p>

              <li style="font-weight: bold;">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">At Dev Academy, I am aiming to level up my time management skills so I can keep everything organised and meet deadlines with ease. I am also looking to boost my confidence, making me more assertive and ready to shine in every challenge. Plus, I want to get better at asking for help when I need it, so I can get the support I need to overcome obstacles and make the most of my learning journey.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                <ul>
                  <li style="font-weight: lighter;">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
                  <li style="font-weight: lighter;">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">To keep things productive and safe, I am planning to create a schedule that fits in time for studying, work, and personal activities. This way, I will hopefully stay organised and ensure I meet deadlines. Plus, I will stay in touch with my facilitators and work managers to discuss progress and address any issues as they come up.</p>
              <p style="color: #608062;">When things get overwhelming, I will take short breaks and treat myself to manage stress. I will focus on the major tasks and use tools like AI, task lists, and Toggl to stay on top of my workload. And if I need a bit of help, I will reach out to my facilitators—whether through study groups or one-on-one chats.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">If I am stuck for more than 20 minutes, I can reach out to my facilitators on the Help Desk Discord. This way, I will also be able to see other students questions, which might help me resolve my issue more effectively.</p>
              <p style="color: #608062;">If I am falling behind and require an extension, I will contact my facilitator directly well before the deadline.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">I am looking for clear guidance on assignments and constructive feedback to help me improve. Regular check-ins and support will keep me on track. I also hope the facilitation team will be approachable and available for questions and discussions, creating a supportive learning environment—much like the north star guiding my journey.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
              </li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">I have work during the week but have communicated with them that I am a student, and the response was very supportive. </p>
