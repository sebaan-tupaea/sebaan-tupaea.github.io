          <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">My long-term goal is to become a skilled DevOps engineer, focusing on automating workflows, solving complex problems, and ensuring seamless IT operations. I aim to master the tools and practices essential for optimising infrastructure and enhancing system reliability.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">I hope to use the skills gained from this course to contribute effectively to development projects, streamline processes, and drive innovation. My goal is to make a positive impact by improving efficiency and reliability in tech environments. I aim to secure a role in a dynamic tech company where I can apply my DevOps expertise to solve real-world problems and contribute to impactful projects.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">My strengths include a strong technical aptitude, persistence in problem-solving, and adaptability in learning approaches. These will help me tackle challenging topics and stay engaged. However, my limitations include struggles with time management and balancing multiple tasks, which can lead to procrastination and perfectionism. Improving these areas will be crucial for my success in Bootcamp.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">Throughout Foundations, I have recognised that my persistence and technical skills are significant assets, while my challenges with time management and perfectionism remain relevant. I have also discovered the importance of teamwork and effective communication. These skills will be vital in Bootcamp, helping me navigate group work and manage workload effectively while addressing my personal growth areas.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">My biggest non-technical challenge will likely be staying focused and managing my workload effectively over the nine weeks. Balancing intense learning with personal commitments and maintaining motivation throughout the Bootcamp will be crucial.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">I want to develop skills in communication, teamwork, and self-awareness. Enhancing my ability to collaborate effectively, give and receive feedback, and lead when necessary will be important for my personal and professional growth. I also aim to improve my confidence and assertiveness in challenging situations.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">I expect clear guidance on assignments, constructive feedback, and regular check-ins to keep me on track. I hope the Bootcamp team will be approachable and available for questions, creating a supportive environment that fosters learning and growth.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">I expect to actively engage with all learning materials, seek help proactively when needed, and contribute constructively to group work. Maintaining a balanced approach to managing workload and self-care will be essential for my success.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">If I encounter difficulties, I will seek help by reaching out to facilitators on the Help Desk Discord if I am stuck for more than 20 minutes. I will also use study groups and one-on-one chats for additional support if necessary. For extensions or significant issues, I will contact my facilitator well before the deadline.</p>
            
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives.</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">To manage my workload effectively, I will create a structured schedule that balances studying, work, and personal activities. I will stay organised by setting clear goals and priorities. Regular communication with facilitators and peers will help me address issues promptly. I will also use tools like AI, task lists, and Toggl to keep track of my progress and manage stress by taking breaks when needed.</p>

            <ol>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
             <p style="color: #608062;">My long-term goal is to be the ‘guy in the chair’ xx</p>
             <p style="color: #608062;">Long term, I want to be a DevOps engineer—getting into automating workflows, solving problems, and keeping the IT scene on flawless. As a student, I am hungry to learn, level up, and bring some real drive to the tech game, making sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">I have a passion for learning and exploring new ideas, which keeps me curious and motivated to dive deeper. I am pretty persistent, tackling tough problems until I solve them, and I am adaptable, able to switch up my learning approach to fit different materials and teaching styles. These strengths help me grow and stay engaged with challenging topics.</p>
              <p style="color: #608062;">However, time management is where I struggle the most. Juggling multiple complex subjects and other responsibilities can be overwhelming, and I sometimes fall into procrastination or end up rushing my work at the last minute. My perfectionism does not help either, as it slows me down, making it hard to move on until everything feels just right. Improving how I balance these elements is something I really need to work on.</p>

              <li style="font-weight: bold;">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">At Dev Academy, I am aiming to level up my time management skills so I can keep everything organised and meet deadlines with ease. I am also looking to boost my confidence, making me more assertive and ready to shine in every challenge. Plus, I want to get better at asking for help when I need it, so I can get the support I need to overcome obstacles and make the most of my learning journey.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                <ul>
                  <li style="font-weight: lighter;">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
                  <li style="font-weight: lighter;">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">To keep things productive and safe, I am planning to create a schedule that fits in time for studying, work, and personal activities. This way, I will hopefully stay organised and ensure I meet deadlines. Plus, I will stay in touch with my facilitators and work managers to discuss progress and address any issues as they come up.</p>
              <p style="color: #608062;">When things get overwhelming, I will take short breaks and treat myself to manage stress. I will focus on the major tasks and use tools like AI, task lists, and Toggl to stay on top of my workload. And if I need a bit of help, I will reach out to my facilitators—whether through study groups or one-on-one chats.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">If I am stuck for more than 20 minutes, I can reach out to my facilitators on the Help Desk Discord. This way, I will also be able to see other students questions, which might help me resolve my issue more effectively.</p>
              <p style="color: #608062;">If I am falling behind and require an extension, I will contact my facilitator directly well before the deadline.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">I am looking for clear guidance on assignments and constructive feedback to help me improve. Regular check-ins and support will keep me on track. I also hope the facilitation team will be approachable and available for questions and discussions, creating a supportive learning environment—much like the north star guiding my journey.</p>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
              </li>
              <p style="color: #608062;">I have work during the week but have communicated with them that I am a student, and the response was very supportive. </p>
