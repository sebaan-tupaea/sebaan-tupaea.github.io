            <li style="font-weight: bold;">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS:</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">JavaScript is like the spontaneous friend who turns a girls' trip into an adventure. HTML is the friend who meticulously plans the itinerary and organises all the travel details. CSS is the friend who picks out the best outfits and makes sure everyone's photos are perfect.</p>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those):</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">Itâ€™s 21st season! Control flow is like deciding the order of tasks to get ready for pre's. I start with a list of things like showering, doing my makeup, straightening my hair, painting my nails, and buying drinks. I follow a sequence based on what is happening in the moment. If I am running late, I might skip painting my nails. If I have plenty of time, I will do everything on my list. This is similar to how control flow works in programming. I make decisions and adjust my actions based on specific conditions to make sure everything goes smoothly.</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;">
              So now it is time to pick an outfit. I start by trying on one dress and checking if it is the right choice. If it is not, I go back to my closet and try another one. I keep trying on different outfits, checking if they look good, and trying more until I find the perfect one. This repetitive process is like a loop in programming, where I keep performing a task until a specific condition is met.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">The Document Object Model is a way to represent and interact with the elements of a web page. It is like a map that shows the structure of a page, including headings, paragraphs, and images. For example, if you want to change the text in a paragraph, you can use JavaScript to find that paragraph by its ID and update the text. This lets you modify the content and layout of the page as needed.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Arrays:</strong> An array is like a list of items. You access elements by their position or index in the list, starting from 0. For example, if you have an array of favourite fruits, you might access the second fruit with fruits[1].</p>
            <p style="color: #608062;"><strong>Objects:</strong> Objects are like a collection of labelled boxes, where each label (key) is paired with a specific item (value). You access data by using the key. For instance, if you have an object representing a person with keys for name and age, you would access the name with person.name and the age with person.age.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful:</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">Functions are like shortcuts in programming. They let you pack a bunch of instructions into one set of curly brackets, which you can use whenever you need. For example, you can create a function to calculate the total cost of items in your shopping cart. Functions keep your code neat, prevent you from repeating yourself, and make fixing issues easier. </p>
