            <li style="font-weight: bold;">What is Emotional Intelligence?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">Emotional Intelligence is all about recognising, understanding, and managing your own feelings and those of others. It includes self-awareness, letting you know how your emotions impact you. With self-regulation, you can stay calm and collected even under stress. Motivation keeps you laser-focused on your goals, while empathy helps you tune into and understand other people's feelings. Social skills are essential for managing relationships, communicating effectively, and resolving conflicts. Overall, Emotional Intelligence is your ticket to navigating social situations, making smart decisions, and building strong, positive connections. </p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;"> How is EQ different to IQ?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) differ in their focus and nature. EQ measures your ability to understand and manage emotions, including skills like empathy and social interactions, and can be developed over time with practice. In contrast, IQ assesses cognitive abilities such as problem-solving and logical reasoning, reflecting innate intellectual skills that remain relatively stable. While EQ is crucial for effective communication and building relationships, IQ is important for academic and professional achievement in technical areas. Both are valuable, but they serve different roles in personal and career success.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Why is EQ important?</li>
            <p style="color: #608062;">
              EQ is key because it helps you really get and empathise with your own and others' emotions. With high EQ, you improve your ability to communicate, build relationships, and handle stress. Whether in work or personal life, having strong EQ boosts your teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution skills. </p>
